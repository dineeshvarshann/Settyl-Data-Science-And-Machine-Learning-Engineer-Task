# Settyl-Data-Science-And-Machine-Learning-Engineer-Task (with small dataset)

1. Data Preprocessing:
Clean and format the external status descriptions and internal status labels.
Convert text data into numerical representations that can be used for training the machine learning model.
2. Model Development:
Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm and architecture.
Develop the model using TensorFlow or similar frameworks.
Experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance.
3. Model Training and Evaluation:
Split the preprocessed dataset into training and validation sets.
Train the developed model on the training set.
Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall on the validation set.
4. API Development:
Implement an API using FastAPI framework to expose the trained machine learning model.
Create an endpoint to accept external status descriptions as input and return predicted internal status labels.
5. Testing and Validation:
Thoroughly test the developed API to ensure its functionality and accuracy.
Validate the predictions against a validation dataset to measure the model's generalization ability.
6. Documentation:
Document the entire development process, including data preprocessing steps, model architecture, training procedure, API implementation, and testing results.
Provide explanations, code snippets, and insights at each step for clarity and reproducibility.
